### The Original Automated Dat Checker
## About
CheckEmAll or CHEA is The Original Automated Dat Checker. CheckEmAll automates the process of checking for differences in game and ROM names.  
  
CheckEmAll compares a Redump ISO datafile to a NKit datafile and lists the differences in game and ROM names. It could possibly compare other dats, but wasn't designed to do so.  
## Dependencies
.Net Framework 4.7.2  
## How to Check Game and ROM Names
- Load your Redump ISO datafile on one side and your NKit datafile on the other side.
- Check and uncheck which filter options to use.
- Save a list on either side as needed.
